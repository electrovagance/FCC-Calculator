# Front End Libraries Projects - Build a JavaScript Calculator

## Objective
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wgGVVX.
A list of user stories for passing the test can be found [here](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator). 
The layout of the calculator is based on the Samsung/Android calculator, a screenshot can be seen [here](src/images/samsung-calc.jpg).
